# COMP-250-Assignment-3

This assignment required us to create a basic decision tree to analyze spatial data for a startup software company. To classify a data item (datum), we
started at the root and followed a path to a leaf. Each internal node needed to have an attribute test to determine which child node to follow on 
the path to a leaf. For the sake of this assignment, we focused solely on binary decision trees.

In order to determine a good attribute to split the data, we were required to use entropy calculations. In the case of this project, we were required 
to take a brute force approach: considering all possible splits and choosing the one with the lowest average entropy.
